# STA-215-Final-Project
For my final project for my STAT 215 course, I analyzed the top 200 songs since the year 2000. 

# Data
My group and I found the top 200 songs from 2000 by using websites online, then we made a spreadsheet where we put every artist and the name of the song. We made a variety of variables to analyze such as speed of the song, intended age group of the song, tickets sold, and more.  Our group ended up with 25 variables that we used the top 200 songs to further analyze. For our research, we used a variety of websites online such as Youtube, Spotify, Genius, and other music related websites.
